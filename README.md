# 🦠 COVID-19, Influenza, and Pneumonia Death Analysis (2020–2024)

This project explores death rates due to **COVID-19**, **influenza**, and **pneumonia** across the United States from **2020 to 2024**. Using CDC mortality data, the goal is to understand trends, relationships, and how these diseases impacted different states over time.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze yearly death counts across the U.S.
- Compare **COVID-19** with **flu** and **pneumonia**
- Explore correlations between the three causes

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **R Programming**
- **R Markdown** for reporting
- `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`
- **Negative Binomial modeling** modeling
- **Correlation analysis**
- Data sourced from the **CDC**

## 📊 Key Outputs

- 📈 Line graphs showing death rate trends (2020–2024)
- 📉 Correlation matrix between diseases
- 🗺️ State-by-state breakdowns and visualizations
- 🔮 Analysis of death numbers(2020–2024) Through a negative binomial regression with interaction
- 🗺️ Utilized an interactive map to visualize the temporal and spatial impact of various diseases across U.S. states.
